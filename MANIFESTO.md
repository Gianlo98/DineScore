# 🟣 DineScore Manifesto  
### *Where the whole table speaks.*

---

## 🍽️ 1. Dining is a Collective Act  
Food isn't just consumed — it's shared.  
At DineScore, reviews aren't left by lone diners. They're created by **everyone at the table**, capturing the full spectrum of the dining experience.

---

## 👥 2. Everyone Gets a Voice  
Whether you're a seasoned sommelier or a curious newcomer, your opinion matters.  
Each guest votes across multiple dimensions:  
- **Taste**  
- **Service**  
- **Atmosphere**  
- **Drinks**  
- **Value**

The result? A **layered, nuanced review** you can actually trust.

---

## 🎟️ 3. Invite-Only, Always  
We don’t want everyone.  
We want the right people — curious, passionate food lovers who value authenticity over hype.  
Membership is by **invitation only**, and reviews come from **verified, trusted tables**.

---

## 🧭 4. Nuance Over Noise  
No simplistic stars. No anonymous rants.  
DineScore replaces surface-level ratings with structured, multidimensional group reviews that reflect the **true complexity** of dining out.

---

## 🇮🇹 5. Born from La Tavola  
Inspired by the Italian tradition of **long meals, deep conversations, and honest opinions**, DineScore believes that the table is sacred — and so is what it says.  
We’re global in reach, but rooted in that spirit of **connection and presence**.

---

## 🚫 6. No Influencers. No Sponsored Lies.  
Restaurants can’t pay to be listed.  
There are no algorithms pushing promoted spots.  
Every DineScore review is **unfiltered, unpaid, and earned** — by the food, the service, and the experience.

---

## 🌍 7. A Passport for the Palate  
Whether you're exploring Michelin-starred dining or hidden local gems, DineScore is your gateway to **authentic recommendations from real people**, in real-time, with real taste.

---

## 🧡 8. We’re Not a Review App. We’re a Movement.  
We’re building a platform for **curated food discovery**, powered by trust, depth, and human connection.  
This is the future of food reviews — **social, credible, and dimensional**.
